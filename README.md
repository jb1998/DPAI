# DPAI- Disease Prediction using Artificial Intelligence

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.svg?v=102)](https://github.com/jb1998)  &nbsp;&nbsp;


# Objective : 

* To predict diseases[Covid-19, Heart problem, Diabetes] using AI models. 
* To provide latest information on diseases from trusted sources including news channels like The times of India 

# Link to this live project? 

* Okay, so this is the hardest part for me.  
* The app was launched live on playstore but it is suspended by Google ðŸ˜Ÿ
* The problem is that Covid-19 is a sensitive topic and there might be some spam apps that might come up.
* So at present only government supported apps are allowed on playstore related to covid-19.
* I really respect this decision ðŸŒŸ but at present I am trying to contact them to explain my app.

# Let's now dive into Screenshots
